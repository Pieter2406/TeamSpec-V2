# Stories

## Workflow Folders

| Folder | Status | Owner |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `backlog/` | New stories | FA |
| `ready-to-refine/` | Ready for dev refinement | FA |
| `ready-for-development/` | Refined, ready for sprint | DEV |

## Rules

- Every story must link to features in the Feature Canon
- Stories describe DELTAS (changes), not full behavior
- Use `ts:fa story` to create properly formatted stories
