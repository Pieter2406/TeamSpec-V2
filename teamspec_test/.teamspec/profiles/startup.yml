# Startup / MVP Profile

> **Version:** 2.0  
> **Applies To:** Startups, MVP development, rapid prototyping

This profile reduces documentation overhead while maintaining Feature Canon integrity.

---

## Profile Characteristics

| Aspect | Configuration |
|--------|---------------|
| Governance Level | Minimal |
| Sign-off Required | No |
| Audit Trail | No |
| Change Control Board | No |
| Documentation | Lean |

---

## Adjusted Checkpoints

### Definition of Ready Simplifications

| Standard Check | Startup Adjustment |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Full dev plan required | Task list sufficient |
| Formal risk assessment | Quick risk note OK |
| Multiple approvers | Single FA approval |

### Definition of Done Simplifications

| Standard Check | Startup Adjustment |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Comprehensive test coverage | Critical path tests OK |
| Formal code review | Pair programming counts |
| Full documentation update | README update sufficient |

---

## Feature Canon (Still Required!)

Even in startup mode, Feature Canon is mandatory:

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| Feature files | Required (can be minimal) |
| Story-feature links | Required |
| Delta format | Recommended |
| Story Ledger | Simplified OK |

> ⚠️ **Feature Canon is NOT optional.** It prevents knowledge loss as the team scales.

## Recommended Practices

1. **Time-box documentation** — 15 min max per story
2. **Living docs** — Update as you code, not after
3. **Lightweight ADRs** — One-pager decisions
4. **Skip sprints** — Use Kanban if velocity matters more than planning

---

## When to Graduate

Consider moving to `enterprise` or `regulated` profile when:

- Team grows beyond 5 people
- First paying customer
- External audit required
- Series A funding
- Compliance requirements emerge

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Bad |
|--------------|--------------|
| No Feature Canon | "We'll document later" = never |
| No story tracking | Can't measure velocity |
| Skipping tests entirely | Technical debt explodes |
| One giant feature file | Unmaintainable |
