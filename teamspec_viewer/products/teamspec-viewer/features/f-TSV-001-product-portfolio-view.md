## Governing Decisions

| Decision ID | Summary | Impact on This Feature |
|-------------|---------|------------------------|
| ta-TSV-002 | Hono.js backend server | Backend provides /api/products endpoint for product listing |

---

## Purpose

Enable users to see the set of existing products and understand which projects have impact on each product.

---

## Business Value

- **User Impact**: Reduces time spent navigating folders and interpreting naming conventions to understand documentation ownership and project impact.
- **Business Impact**: Improves TeamSpec adoption by making product documentation approachable and discoverable.
- **Success Metrics**: User can identify all products and their targeting projects within 30 seconds of opening the viewer

---

## In Scope

- [ ] Display a list of products.
- [ ] For a selected product, show which projects have impact on that product.
- [ ] Display basic product metadata (including PRX prefix and status).

---

## Out of Scope

- [ ] Editing products or product metadata in the viewer.
- [ ] Permission management (assumes read access).

## Actors / Personas

| Persona | Description | Primary Goals |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Product Owner | Oversees products and projects | Understand portfolio state and project relationships |
| Business Analyst | Consumes BA artifacts across products/projects | Find relevant product documentation quickly |
| Functional Analyst | Consumes features/FIs across products/projects | Understand what changes are proposed and where |

## Current Behavior

### Product Listing

No deployed behavior exists (greenfield product). MVP implements product listing via `/api/products` endpoint.

### Product → Project Impact

No deployed behavior exists (greenfield product). MVP implements project listing via `/api/products/:productId/projects` endpoint.

### User Flows

1. User opens viewer → sees product portfolio (currently hardcoded to teamspec-viewer for MVP)
2. User selects product → sees list of projects targeting that product
3. User selects project → enters project context for dashboard navigation

### Edge Cases & Error Handling

| Condition | System Response |
|-----------|-----------------|
| No products found | Display "No products found" message |
| Product has no projects | Display "No projects target this product" message |
| product.yml missing | Derive product name from folder name |

---

## Business Rules

| Rule ID | Rule Description | Applies When |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| BR-TSV-001 | Products are the root of all documentation | Always |
| BR-TSV-002 | Projects propose changes to one or more products | When showing project impact for a product |

---

## Roles & Permissions

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| All Users | Read-only access to product portfolio view |
| PO | Primary consumer for portfolio oversight |
| BA/FA | Consumers for artifact navigation entry point |

---

## Non-Functional Notes

- **Performance**: Product list should load within 2 seconds for workspaces with <50 products
- **Security**: Read-only access; no authentication required for local viewer
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for navigation elements
- **Availability**: Local application; availability depends on user's machine

---

## Non-Goals

- Provide a file-explorer experience equivalent to Obsidian.

---

## Open Questions

| ID | Question | Owner | Status | Resolution |
|----|----------|-------|--------|------------|
| Q-001 | What is the authoritative source of "product status" in the product structure (field name + allowed values)? | SA | Resolved | `product.status` in product.yml; values: "active", "deprecated", "archived" (default: "active") |
