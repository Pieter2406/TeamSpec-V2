# Bug Report: `bug-{project-id}-{NNN}-{description}`

<!--
  ⚠️ BUG CLASSIFICATION IS MANDATORY

  When reporting bugs, you MUST classify whether the issue is:
  - Implementation defect (code doesn't match Canon)
  - Feature Canon wrong (Canon doesn't match business intent)
  - Undocumented behavior (neither covers this case)

  Classification determines who fixes what.

  NAMING PATTERN: bug-{project-id}-{NNN}-{description}.md
  EXAMPLE: bug-q1-auth-042-oauth-timeout.md

  TEAMSPEC RULES ENFORCED:
  - TS-QA-002: Bug classification required (exactly one)

## Description

> **Contract:** Clear summary of what's wrong.  
> **Required precision:** Observable symptom, not root cause guess.  
> **Not this:** Steps to reproduce (those go in next section).

> Brief summary of the bug.

[Clear, concise description of what's wrong]

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Go to ...
2. Click ...
3. Enter ...
4. Observe ...

---

## Expected Result

> What should happen (reference Feature Canon if applicable).

**Feature Canon Reference:** [f-{PRX}-{NNN}](../../products/{product-id}/features/f-{PRX}-{NNN}-*.md), Section: [Section Name]

[What the system should do according to Feature Canon]

---

## Actual Result

> What actually happened.

[What the system actually does]

---

## Evidence

> Attach Screenshots/Logs/Videos

- [ ] Screenshot attached
- [ ] Console logs attached
- [ ] Network trace attached

---

## Bug Classification (MANDATORY)

> **Contract:** Exactly one classification determining fix responsibility.  
> **Required precision:** Select ONE with evidence.  
> **Not this:** Multiple classifications or "unknown".

<!-- TEAMSPEC RULE: TS-QA-002 - Exactly one must be checked -->

> ⚠️ Select **exactly ONE** classification. This determines who fixes what.

### [ ] Implementation Defect

**Definition:** Code doesn't match Feature Canon documentation.

- **Evidence:** Feature Canon says [X], system does [Y]
- **Fix:** DEV fixes code to match Canon
- **Canon Update:** Not required

### [ ] Feature Canon Wrong

**Definition:** Feature Canon doesn't match actual business intent.

- **Evidence:** Business expects [X], Canon says [Y]
- **Fix:** FA updates Feature Canon, then DEV updates code if needed
- **Canon Update:** Required

### [ ] Undocumented Behavior

**Definition:** Neither code nor Feature Canon covers this case.

- **Evidence:** [Scenario] is not documented anywhere
- **Fix:** FA clarifies with BA, updates Canon, then DEV implements
- **Canon Update:** Required

## Classification Decision Tree

```
Is the behavior documented in Feature Canon?
├── YES → Does code match Canon?
│   ├── YES → Not a bug (or Canon is wrong → "Feature Canon Wrong")
│   └── NO → "Implementation Defect"
└── NO → "Undocumented Behavior"
```
