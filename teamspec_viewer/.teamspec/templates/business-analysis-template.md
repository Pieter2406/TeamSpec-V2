# Business Analysis: `ba-{PRX}-{NNN}-{description}`

<!--
  ⚠️ THIS IS A PLANNING ARTIFACT, NOT SOURCE OF TRUTH

  This Business Analysis document captures analysis and decisions
  during the planning phase.

  SOURCE OF TRUTH:
  - For current system behavior → Feature Canon (f-{PRX}-{NNN}.md)
  - For business decisions → Decision Log (dec-{PRX}-{NNN}.md)

  This document becomes HISTORICAL after Feature Canon is created.

  NAMING PATTERN: ba-{PRX}-{NNN}-{description}.md
