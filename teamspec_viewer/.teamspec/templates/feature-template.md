  2. No technical implementation details
  3. Business rules use BR-{PRX}-NNN format
  4. Change Log is append-only
  5. Feature ID uses product prefix (PRX)

  NAMING PATTERN: f-{PRX}-{NNN}-{description}.md
  EXAMPLE: f-ACME-001-user-login.md

  TEAMSPEC RULES ENFORCED:
  - TS-FEAT-001: Feature must have unique ID
  - TS-FEAT-002: All required sections must be present
