# TeamSpec Configuration
# Version: 4.0.0

version: "4.0"
name: "TeamSpec Product-Canon Operating Model"

# Core principles
principles:
  - Product Canon is the source of truth for production behavior (AS-IS)
  - Feature-Increments propose changes to products (TO-BE)
  - Stories describe deltas (changes), not full behavior
  - Canon is updated ONLY after deployment via ts:po sync
  - Structural artifacts require explicit creation commands
  - Each role has clear ownership boundaries
