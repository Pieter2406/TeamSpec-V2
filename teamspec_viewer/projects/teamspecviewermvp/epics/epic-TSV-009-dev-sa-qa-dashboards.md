## Epic Summary

**As a** Developer, Solution Architect, or QA Engineer,  
**I want** a role-specific dashboard that lets me navigate the artifacts relevant to my role,  
**So that** I can quickly access dev-plans, technical architectures, test cases, and other role-owned artifacts without navigating folder structures.

## Linked Product

| Product ID | PRX | Product Name |
|------------|-----|--------------|
| [teamspec-viewer](../../products/teamspec-viewer/product.yml) | TSV | Teamspec Viewer |

---

## Feature-Increments

| FI ID | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [fi-TSV-009](../feature-increments/fi-TSV-009-dev-sa-qa-role-dashboards.md) | DEV/SA/QA role selection + dashboard navigation entry points for technical team artifacts | Proposed |

---

## TO-BE / Business Value

### Value Proposition

- **User Impact**: DEV, SA, and QA users can reliably find role-owned artifacts and navigate directly to relevant documentation.
- **Business Impact**: Completes the dashboard coverage for technical team roles, enabling full team adoption of the TeamSpec Viewer.
- **Success Metrics**: 
  - Time to find artifact < 30 seconds
  - Dashboard navigation covers 100% of DEV/SA/QA artifact types
  - All technical roles have dedicated dashboard access

### Target State

- A user can select **DEV** and see a curated list of dev-plans, stories, and technical documentation.
- A user can select **SA** and see a curated list of solution designs, technical architectures, and their project increments.
- A user can select **QA** and see a curated list of test cases, regression tests, and bug reports.
- When reading an artifact, `{TBD}` markers are visually highlighted and the user can navigate between occurrences.

## Scope

### In Scope

- [ ] Extend RoleSelector to include DEV, SA, QA options
- [ ] DEV dashboard entry points to dev-plans, stories, technical architecture
- [ ] SA dashboard entry points to solution designs, technical architectures, and increments
- [ ] QA dashboard entry points to test cases, regression tests, bug reports
- [ ] `{TBD}` marker highlight + navigation while viewing an artifact (existing behavior)

### Out of Scope

- [ ] Dashboards for other roles (SM, PO, DES)
- [ ] Sprint context selection for DEV dashboard
- [ ] Editing or resolving `{TBD}` items from within the viewer
- [ ] Permissions or access control

## Dependencies

### Depends On

| Dependency | Type | Status | Impact |
|------------|------|--------|--------|
| [fi-TSV-001](../feature-increments/fi-TSV-001-ba-fa-role-dashboards.md) | Requires | Done | BA/FA dashboard pattern provides foundation |
| [f-TSV-002](../../products/teamspec-viewer/features/f-TSV-002-role-specific-dashboards.md) | Requires | Active | Target feature for dashboard behavior |
| [epic-TSV-001](epic-TSV-001-dashboard-implementation.md) | Requires | Done | Initial dashboard implementation complete |

### Blocked By

- [ ] None (can proceed when stories are ready)

---

## Risks & Assumptions

### Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Inconsistent artifact structure for DEV/SA/QA across projects | Medium | Medium | Define clear API contracts and validate against teamspec-viewer project |
| Large number of test cases causing performance issues | Low | Medium | Implement pagination/lazy loading |
| Scope creep to include SM/PO/DES dashboards | Medium | Low | Strictly enforce out-of-scope definition |

### Assumptions

- Existing BA/FA dashboard patterns (components, API structure) can be reused
- Dev-plans, test cases, and bug reports follow consistent naming conventions
- Solution designs and technical architectures exist in product structure

---

## Technical Considerations

_High-level technical approach (SA input)._

- **Architecture Impact**: Extends existing dashboard infrastructure; no new architectural patterns required
- **Related TAI**: None required (uses existing ta-TSV-001 patterns)
- **Performance Considerations**: May need pagination for QA artifacts if test case count is high

**Frontend Components:**
- DEVDashboard.tsx (follows FADashboard pattern)
- SADashboard.tsx (follows FADashboard pattern)
- QADashboard.tsx (follows FADashboard pattern)
- DevPlanTree.tsx, TestCaseTree.tsx, BugReportTree.tsx (tree navigation)

**Backend Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/products/:productId/technical-architecture`
- `GET /api/products/:productId/solution-designs`
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/dev-plans`
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/test-cases`
- `GET /api/products/:productId/regression-tests`
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/bug-reports`

---

## Acceptance Criteria

_Epic-level acceptance criteria (rolled up from stories)._

- [ ] All linked stories marked as Done
- [ ] DEV, SA, QA roles selectable in RoleSelector
- [ ] Each role has dedicated dashboard with appropriate artifact navigation
- [ ] Feature Canon updated via `ts:po sync`
- [ ] UAT completed and signed off
