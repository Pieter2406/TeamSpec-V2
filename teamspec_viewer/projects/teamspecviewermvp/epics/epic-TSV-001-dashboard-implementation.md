|-------|-------|
| **Epic ID** | epic-TSV-001 |
| **Status** | Proposed |
| **Product** | teamspec-viewer (TSV) |
| **Owner** | FA (Functional Analyst) |

## Epic Summary

**As a** BA or FA,  
**I want** a role-specific dashboard that lets me navigate the artifacts relevant to my role,  
**So that** I can quickly understand what exists and what is still missing (via `{TBD}` markers) without navigating folder structures.

## Linked Product

| Product ID | PRX | Product Name |
|------------|-----|--------------|
| [teamspec-viewer](../../products/teamspec-viewer/product.yml) | TSV | Teamspec Viewer |

## Feature-Increments

| FI ID | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [fi-TSV-001](../feature-increments/fi-TSV-001-ba-fa-role-dashboards.md) | BA/FA role selection + dashboard navigation entry points + `{TBD}` highlighting/navigation | Proposed |

---

## TO-BE / Business Value

### Value Proposition

- **User Impact**: BA and FA users can reliably find role-owned artifacts and identify missing documentation quickly.
- **Business Impact**: Reduces time spent interpreting TeamSpec structure and increases documentation completeness visibility.
- **Success Metrics**: Time to find artifact < 30 seconds; Dashboard navigation covers 100% of BA/FA artifact types

### Target State

- A user can select **BA** or **FA** and see a curated list of role-owned artifacts for the selected product/project context.
- When reading an artifact, `{TBD}` markers are visually highlighted and the user can navigate between occurrences.

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- [ ] BA/FA role selection for this project slice
- [ ] BA dashboard entry points to BA artifacts
- [ ] FA dashboard entry points to FA artifacts
- [ ] `{TBD}` marker highlight + navigation while viewing an artifact

### Out of Scope

- [ ] Dashboards for other roles (DEV, QA, SA, SM, DES)
- [ ] Editing or resolving `{TBD}` items from within the viewer

## Dependencies

### Depends On

| Dependency | Type | Status | Impact |
|------------|------|--------|--------|
| [f-TSV-002](../../products/teamspec-viewer/features/f-TSV-002-role-specific-dashboards.md) | Requires | Planned | Target feature for dashboard behavior |

### Blocked By

- [ ] None (can proceed when stories are ready)

---

## Risks & Assumptions

### Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Dashboard scope creeps beyond BA/FA slice | Medium | High | Keep non-BA/FA roles explicitly out of scope for this Epic |

### Assumptions

- The viewer remains read-only for artifacts.

---

## Technical Considerations

- **Architecture Impact**: Frontend component structure for role-based navigation; backend API endpoints for artifact listing
- **Related TA/TAI**: [TA-001](../../products/teamspec-viewer/technical-architecture/ta-TSV-001-react-browser-frontend.md) (React frontend), [TA-002](../../products/teamspec-viewer/technical-architecture/ta-TSV-002-hono-backend-server.md) (Hono backend)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All linked stories marked as Done
- [ ] Feature-Increment `fi-TSV-001` acceptance criteria verified by QA
