## Epic Summary

**As a** TSV engineering team (FA/DEV/SA/QA),  
**I want** the frontend refactored to a modular folder architecture with shared components and barrel exports,  
**So that** the role dashboards feature can scale, stay maintainable, and enable faster implementation across FA/BA/DEV/SA/QA.

## TO-BE / Business Value

### Value Proposition

- **User Impact**: Faster dashboard delivery across all roles; consistent tree and status-editing patterns; clearer navigation for engineers.
- **Business Impact**: Reduced development/maintenance cost via shared components; improved reliability and feature parity between dashboards.
- **Success Metrics**:
  - 100% dashboard components use shared StatusDropdown + ArtifactTree
  - Import path reduction: >80% files use barrel exports/aliases
  - Build passes and viewer runs without broken imports

### Target State

- Frontend organized under `shared/`, `features/`, and `api/` modules with barrel exports.
- Role dashboards located under `features/dashboards/{role}/` with shared submodule for common UI.
- Shared components (StatusDropdown, TBDIndicator, ArtifactTree, ArtifactReader) consumed consistently across FA/BA/DEV/SA/QA.
- Path aliases configured (`@/shared`, `@/features`, `@/api`) and adopted across the codebase.

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- [ ] Introduce `shared/` module with components, hooks, contexts, utils, constants
- [ ] Introduce `features/` module with `dashboards/{role}` folders and shared dashboard components
- [ ] Create barrel exports (`index.ts`) for all modules and submodules
- [ ] Configure TS + Vite path aliases and migrate imports
- [ ] Migrate dashboard components (FA/BA/DEV/SA/QA) to new structure
- [ ] Align tree/status components usage across dashboards

### Out of Scope

- [ ] Backend changes (scope: frontend organization only)
- [ ] New user-facing features (refactor-only)
- [ ] Status vocabulary or backend API schema changes

## Dependencies

### Depends On

| Dependency | Type | Status | Impact |
|------------|------|--------|--------|
| [f-TSV-002](../../products/teamspec-viewer/features/f-TSV-002-role-specific-dashboards.md) | Requires | Active | Target feature for dashboards behavior |
| [fi-TSV-009](../feature-increments/fi-TSV-009-dev-sa-qa-role-dashboards.md) | Requires | Active | Epic delivers architecture to support FI-TSV-009 |
| [tai-TSV-002](../technical-architecture-increments/tai-TSV-002-frontend-folder-architecture.md) | Guides | Proposed | Technical architecture increment defining structure |

### Blocked By

- [ ] None (can proceed when stories are drafted)

---

## Risks & Assumptions

### Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Large change surface causes broken imports | Medium | High | Incremental migration + CI build checks |
| Divergent dashboard code patterns | Medium | Medium | Enforce shared components + lint rules |
| Path alias misconfiguration | Low | Medium | Validate via `tsc --noEmit` and Vite dev build |

### Assumptions

- Refactor does not change user-observable behavior
- Shared components already exist or can be extracted safely
- Engineers adopt path aliases and barrel export conventions

---

## Technical Considerations

- **Architecture Impact**: Frontend module reorganization; no runtime behavior changes.
- **Related TAI**: [tai-TSV-002-frontend-folder-architecture](../technical-architecture-increments/tai-TSV-002-frontend-folder-architecture.md)
- **Performance Considerations**: Neutral; improved build clarity; potential minor tree-shake improvements via barrels.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All dashboards compile and run post-refactor
- [ ] Shared components used across all role dashboards
- [ ] Path aliases and barrel exports in place; imports updated
- [ ] No broken routes or missing components
- [ ] CI: `npx tsc --noEmit` passes; local `pnpm dev` starts successfully
