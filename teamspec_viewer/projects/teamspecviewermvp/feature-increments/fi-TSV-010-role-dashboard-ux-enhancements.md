# Feature Increment: `fi-TSV-010-role-dashboard-ux-enhancements`

> **Template Version**: 4.0.1  
> **Last Updated**: 2026-01-18

---

> **ID:** fi-TSV-010  
> **Product:** `teamspec-viewer` (TSV)  
> **Target Feature:** `f-TSV-002-role-specific-dashboards`  
> **Epic:** `epic-TSV-011-role-dashboard-ux-polish`  
> **Status:** Active

---

## 1. Overview

This increment enhances the role dashboards with full-viewport layouts, dark mode theming, clearer visual indicators, and discoverable keyboard navigation so each supported role can navigate quickly without sacrificing accessibility.

---

## 2. AS-IS (Current State)

> ⚠️ _Auto-populated from Product Feature. DO NOT EDIT unless correcting errors._

### 2.1 Current Behavior

### Role Selection

User selects BA or FA role via RoleSelector component. Selection is stored in RoleContext and persists for the session. User can switch roles at any time via header role badge.

### Role Dashboard Content

- **BA Dashboard**: Lists business-analysis documents and BA increments for the active product/project
- **FA Dashboard**: Lists features, feature-increments, epics, and stories for the active product/project

### User Flows

1. User opens viewer → sees role selection screen
2. User selects BA or FA → sees role-specific dashboard
3. User clicks artifact → artifact content is displayed in reader
4. User can switch roles via header badge

### Edge Cases & Error Handling

| Condition | System Response |
|-----------|-----------------|
| No artifacts for role | Display "No artifacts found" message |
| Artifact file missing | Show error toast and remain on dashboard |
| Role not selected | Show RoleSelector component |

### 2.2 Current Limitations

- Dashboards are defined for BA and FA; visual and theming behaviors beyond those roles are not specified.
- Accessibility notes expect keyboard navigation, but shortcut discoverability, focus cues, and theme handling (light/dark) are not defined in canon.

---

## 3. TO-BE (Proposed State)

### 3.1 New/Changed Behavior

- Dashboards use the full available viewport (width and height) for all supported roles, adapting layouts responsively for desktop and mobile breakpoints without leaving unused canvas space.
- A dark mode theme is available from the dashboard shell; toggling applies across all role dashboards and preserves WCAG 2.1 AA contrast for text, icons, and focus states.
- Visual indicators are standardized: selection, hover, focus, loading, and error states use consistent tokens and spacing; status badges remain legible in both light and dark modes.
- Keyboard navigation is first-class: arrow keys move between dashboard tiles/lists, Tab/Shift+Tab follow a logical reading order, and Enter/Space activates the focused item while keeping the experience read-only.
- Shortcut discoverability is built-in: each dashboard exposes an inline hint (e.g., "Press ? for shortcuts" or visible key legends) and shows visible focus outlines so users know which keys are available.

### 3.2 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-1: Each supported role dashboard renders using the full viewport without horizontal or vertical clipping on common desktop resolutions and mobile widths ≥320px.
- [ ] AC-2: A dark mode toggle is available from the dashboard UI; switching themes updates all dashboard surfaces (cards, lists, headers, indicators) while maintaining WCAG 2.1 AA contrast.
- [ ] AC-3: Selection, hover, focus, loading, and error indicators are consistent across BA/FA and (when present) other role dashboards, and remain legible in both light and dark themes.
- [ ] AC-4: Keyboard navigation allows moving between dashboard items via arrow keys and Tab/Shift+Tab, with Enter/Space activating the focused item and no loss of focus after activation.
- [ ] AC-5: Users can discover available keyboard shortcuts through visible cues (e.g., inline hint or shortcut help) and see a visible focus indicator at all times during keyboard use.
- [ ] AC-6: Role dashboards remain read-only; no edit affordances are introduced while applying the new UI/UX changes.

### 3.3 Out of Scope

- Adding new role types beyond those already supported in the project scope.
- Changing data sources or backend APIs; work is limited to dashboard presentation and interaction patterns.
- Authentication, authorization, or any persistence of preferences beyond existing session storage.

## 4. Impact Analysis

### 4.1 Affected Features

| Feature | Impact Type | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| f-TSV-002 | Modified | Adds theming, full-viewport layout, visual indicator, and keyboard UX requirements for role dashboards |
| f-TSV-001 | Referenced | Portfolio/product context still used for navigation; no functional change |

### 4.2 Dependencies

- Existing role dashboard routes and data endpoints for supported roles must already be available.
- Current theming or design token system (if present) must be extendable to light/dark modes; otherwise new tokens are required.

### 4.3 Risks

- Risk: Dark mode contrast regressions → Mitigation: enforce WCAG 2.1 AA checks on key surfaces before release.
- Risk: Keyboard focus traps on complex dashboard layouts → Mitigation: test with keyboard-only flows and screen readers.
- Risk: Full-viewport layouts may break on small screens → Mitigation: verify responsive breakpoints down to 320px width.

---

## 5. Implementation Notes

### 5.1 Technical Considerations

- Extend dashboard layout components to support fluid height/width and responsive grid/stack patterns for cards and lists.
- Introduce or extend theme tokens for light/dark variants; ensure indicator states (hover, focus, selected, loading, error) derive from shared tokens to keep consistency across roles.
- Add a shortcuts hint affordance (e.g., help modal or inline legend) wired to a keyboard handler while keeping the viewer read-only.

### 5.2 Testing Strategy

- UI snapshot and visual regression coverage for light/dark themes across role dashboards.
- Keyboard-only and screen-reader validation of focus order, shortcuts, and activation behavior.
- Responsive layout checks at representative breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile ≥320px) to confirm full-viewport usage without clipping.
