# Feature Increment: `fi-TSV-003-ba-fa-artifact-search`

> **Template Version**: 4.0.1  
> **Last Updated**: 2026-01-14

---

> **ID:** fi-TSV-003  
> **Product:** `teamspec-viewer` (TSV)  
> **Target Feature:** `f-TSV-007-artifact-search`  
> **Epic:** epic-TSV-003 (Artifact Search - planned)  
> **Status:** proposed

## 1. Overview

This increment defines MVP behavior for searching artifacts relevant to BA and FA workflows, including filtering by artifact type and role ownership.

---

## 2. AS-IS (Current State)

> ⚠️ _Auto-populated from Product Feature. DO NOT EDIT unless correcting errors._

### 2.1 Current Behavior

(Exact copy from `f-TSV-007-artifact-search` → “Current Behavior”)

### Search Query

No deployed behavior exists (greenfield product).

### Result Filtering

No deployed behavior exists (greenfield product).

### User Flows

1. Not applicable (no prior system).

### Edge Cases & Error Handling

| Condition | System Response |
|-----------|-----------------||
| Not applicable | No prior system |

### 2.2 Current Limitations

- No deployed search behavior exists; Feature Canon is establishing the first specification.

---

## 3. TO-BE (Proposed State)

### 3.1 New/Changed Behavior

After this increment is implemented and synced:

- The system provides a search experience over TeamSpec artifacts.
- The system allows filtering search results by:
  - **Artifact type** (at minimum: BA documents/increments; Features; Feature-Increments; Epics; Stories)
  - **Role ownership** (at minimum: BA and FA)
- Search results provide navigation into the selected artifact.

### 3.2 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-1: A user can enter a search query and receive matching artifacts.
- [ ] AC-2: A user can filter results to only BA-owned artifacts.
- [ ] AC-3: A user can filter results to only FA-owned artifacts.

### 3.3 Out of Scope

- Advanced query language beyond a basic search field.
- Editing artifacts from search results.

## 4. Impact Analysis

### 4.1 Affected Features

| Feature | Impact Type | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| f-TSV-007 | Modified | Defines MVP search behavior and BA/FA filters |
| f-TSV-002 | Referenced | Search entry point from role dashboards |
| f-TSV-001 | Referenced | Search may surface products/projects |

### 4.2 Dependencies

- A consistent artifact indexing approach exists (file structure + front matter).

### 4.3 Risks

- Risk: Search scope and ranking expectations are undefined → Mitigation: keep MVP definition limited to basic search + filters.

---

## 5. Implementation Notes

### 5.1 Technical Considerations

Search implemented server-side in Hono with full-text file scanning. Indexing optional for MVP; simple file-content grep is acceptable for <100 artifacts.

### 5.2 Testing Strategy

Unit tests for search ranking; E2E tests for search input → results → artifact navigation.

## Unresolved Items

- Epic assignment for this FI → epic-TSV-003 (planned for third epic)
- Search ranking rules and indexed fields → Title and headings weighted higher; full body secondary
- Technical and testing notes → Filled above (see sections 5.1, 5.2)
