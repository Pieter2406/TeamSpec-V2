## User Story

**As a** Functional Analyst,  
**I want** Features displayed as prominent interactive cards (rather than one of four equal lists),  
**So that** I immediately see Features as my primary focal artifacts and can expand into related work items.

## Feature Impact

### Impact Type

- [ ] **Adds Behavior**
- [x] **Changes Behavior** — Modifies existing documented behavior
- [ ] **Fixes Defect**
- [ ] **Technical Only**

### AS-IS (current behavior)

**Reference:** f-TSV-002, Section: Current Behavior → Role Dashboard Content

- FA Dashboard displays four equal-weight artifact lists in a 2x2 grid:
  - Features (top-left)
  - Feature-Increments (top-right)
  - Epics (bottom-left)
  - Stories (bottom-right)
- All four lists have equal visual prominence
- User clicks an item → artifact opens in reader

### TO-BE (new behavior)

- FA Dashboard displays **Features as primary focal cards** in a prominent section
- Each Feature card displays:
  - Feature ID and title
  - Feature status (if available)
  - Badge showing count of linked FIs (e.g., "2 FIs")
  - Expand/collapse toggle (▼/►) to reveal linked artifacts
- Feature-Increments, Epics, and Stories are **nested under their parent Feature** (tree structure)
- The four separate equal-weight lists are **removed**

**Sprint:** —  
**Assigned By:** ________________  
**Role:** SM  
**Date:** ________________

## Acceptance Criteria (AC)

### Scenario 1: Features as primary cards

- **Given** the user is on the FA Dashboard
- **When** the dashboard loads
- **Then** Features are displayed as prominent interactive cards
- **And** Features are visually distinguished as primary artifacts (larger, more prominent than nested items)

### Scenario 2: Feature card content

- **Given** a Feature card is displayed
- **When** the user views the card
- **Then** the card shows Feature ID, title, and status
- **And** the card shows a badge with count of linked FIs (e.g., "2 FIs")
- **And** the card has an expand/collapse toggle

### Scenario 3: Four-list layout removed

- **Given** the user is on the FA Dashboard
- **When** the dashboard loads
- **Then** the previous 2x2 grid of four equal artifact lists is no longer displayed
- **And** FIs, Epics, and Stories appear only when nested under a Feature

### Scenario 4: Feature with no FIs

- **Given** a Feature has no linked Feature-Increments
- **When** the Feature card is displayed
- **Then** the badge shows "0 FIs"
- **And** expanding the Feature shows "No linked increments"

---

## Technical Notes

- **Component**: Replace `FADashboard.tsx` grid layout with FeatureCardList component
- **Data**: Use existing `getFeatures()` API; enhance to include FI count
- **UI Library**: MUI Card components for Feature cards
- **State**: Track expanded Feature IDs in component state

---

## UX & Copy

- Card header: `{Feature ID} — {Feature Title}`
- Badge: `{N} FIs` or `0 FIs`
- Toggle icons: ▼ (expanded), ► (collapsed)
- Empty state: "No linked increments"
