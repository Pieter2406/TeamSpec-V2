## User Story

**As a** Developer,  
**I want** a dashboard that shows dev-plans, stories, and technical architecture documents,  
**So that** I can quickly navigate to implementation-related artifacts without browsing folder structures.

## Linked Epic

| Epic ID | Epic Name | Product |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| [epic-TSV-009](../../epics/epic-TSV-009-dev-sa-qa-dashboards.md) | DEV/SA/QA Role Dashboards | TeamSpec Viewer (TSV) |

## Linked Feature-Increment

| FI ID | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [fi-TSV-009](../../feature-increments/fi-TSV-009-dev-sa-qa-role-dashboards.md) | DEV/SA/QA role selection + dashboard navigation |

## Feature Impact

### Impact Type

- [x] **Adds Behavior** — New capability not currently in the feature
- [ ] **Changes Behavior**
- [ ] **Fixes Defect**
- [ ] **Technical Only**

### AS-IS (current behavior)

**Reference:** f-TSV-002, Section: Role Dashboard Content

- Only BA and FA dashboards exist
- Developers must use folder navigation or search to find dev-plans
- No curated view of developer-relevant artifacts

### TO-BE (new behavior)

- New DEVDashboard component provides curated navigation for developers
- Dashboard displays artifacts grouped by type:
  - **Dev Plans** (`dp-eXXX-sYYY-*.md`) from selected project
  - **Stories** (`s-eXXX-YYY-*.md`) from selected project
  - **Technical Architectures** (`ta-PRX-*.md`) from selected product
  - **Technical Architecture Increments** (`tai-PRX-*.md`) from selected project
- Each artifact entry shows:
  - Artifact ID and title
  - Status (e.g., Draft, In-Progress, Implemented)
  - Scope indicator (Product or Project)
- Tree navigation allows drilling into related artifacts:
  - Dev plan → linked story → linked epic
- Empty state message when no artifacts exist for a category

---

## Acceptance Criteria (AC)

### Scenario 1: Display Dev Plans

- **Given** the user is on the DEV dashboard
- **And** dev-plans exist in the selected project
- **When** viewing the "Dev Plans" section
- **Then** all dev-plans are listed with ID, title, and status

### Scenario 2: Display Stories

- **Given** the user is on the DEV dashboard
- **And** stories exist in the selected project
- **When** viewing the "Stories" section
- **Then** all stories are listed with ID, title, and status
- **And** stories are grouped or filterable by status

### Scenario 3: Display Technical Architecture (Product)

- **Given** the user is on the DEV dashboard
- **And** TA documents exist in the selected product
- **When** viewing the "Technical Architecture" section
- **Then** product-level TA documents are listed
- **And** each entry is marked as "Product" scope

### Scenario 4: Display TAI (Project)

- **Given** the user is on the DEV dashboard
- **And** TAI documents exist in the selected project
- **When** viewing the "Technical Architecture Increments" section
- **Then** project-level TAI documents are listed
- **And** each entry is marked as "Project" scope

### Scenario 5: Navigate to Artifact

- **Given** the user is on the DEV dashboard
- **When** the user clicks on a dev-plan entry
- **Then** the artifact content is displayed in the reader panel

### Scenario 6: Empty State

- **Given** the user is on the DEV dashboard
- **And** no dev-plans exist in the selected project
- **When** viewing the "Dev Plans" section
- **Then** message "No dev-plans found" is displayed

### Scenario 7: Navigate from Dev Plan to Story

- **Given** a dev-plan links to story s-e001-042
- **When** the user views the dev-plan tree node
- **Then** the linked story is shown as a child/related item
- **And** the user can navigate to the story

## Technical Notes

- **File**: `frontend/src/components/DEVDashboard.tsx`
- **Components**: Reuse `ArtifactTree` pattern from FADashboard
- **API Calls**:
  - `GET /api/projects/:projectId/dev-plans`
  - `GET /api/projects/:projectId/stories`
  - `GET /api/products/:productId/technical-architecture`
  - `GET /api/projects/:projectId/tai`
- **State**: Use existing product/project context from `ProductContext`

## UX & Copy

| Section | Empty State Message |
|---------|---------------------|
| Dev Plans | No dev-plans found for this project |
| Stories | No stories found for this project |
| Technical Architecture | No TA documents found for this product |
| TAI | No TAI documents found for this project |
