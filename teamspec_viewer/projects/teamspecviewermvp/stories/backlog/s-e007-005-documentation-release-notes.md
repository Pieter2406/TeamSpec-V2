## Feature Impact

### Impact Type

- [ ] **Adds Behavior** — New capability not currently in the feature
- [ ] **Changes Behavior** — Modifies existing documented behavior
- [ ] **Fixes Defect** — Restores behavior to match documentation
- [x] **Technical Only** — Refactor/performance with no user-observable change

### AS-IS (current behavior)

Stories s-e007-001 through s-e007-004 are implemented and tested, but users have no documentation explaining:
- How to use the new "Show Completed Artifacts" filter
- Why artifacts are ordered the way they are
- What the different artifact states mean
- How to find what they're looking for quickly

Users discover features by trial and error, creating confusion and reduced feature adoption.

### TO-BE (new behavior)

Users have comprehensive, user-friendly documentation including:
- **In-app Help**: Tooltips and contextual help explaining filter and ordering
- **Release Notes**: Clear explanation of what changed and why
- **Developer Docs**: Technical documentation for maintainers
- **Feature Canon**: Updated feature documentation reflecting final implementation

---

## Documentation Sections to Create/Update

### 1. In-App Tooltip (Feature: Filter Toggle)

**Location**: Hover/focus on "Show Completed Artifacts" control

**Text:**
> Toggle to show or hide artifacts with completed states: **done, retired, deferred, out-of-scope, archived**. Active work items (in-progress, active, ready, draft, proposed, pending, on-hold) are always visible.

### 2. State Legend (Optional: Display Inline)

**Location**: Near dashboard artifact list or in help sidebar

**Visual:**
```
Active Work (Always Visible)
• In-Progress — Currently being worked on
• Active — Deployed to production
• Ready — Approved for implementation
• Draft — In development, review pending
• Proposed — Proposed, awaiting approval

Waiting (Lower Priority)
• Pending — Waiting for external dependency
• On-Hold — Explicitly paused

Completed (Hidden by Default)
• Done — Completed and closed
• Retired — No longer in use
• Deferred — Moved to later release
• Out-of-Scope — Explicitly excluded
• Archived — Historical reference
```

### 3. Release Notes Template

**File**: `RELEASE_NOTES_TSV_007.md` (or similar)

```markdown
## Dashboard Artifact Filtering and Smart State Ordering

### What's New

Teamspec Viewer dashboards now include two powerful usability improvements:

1. **Artifact Filtering**: Toggle to hide/show completed artifacts and focus on active work
2. **Smart State Ordering**: Artifacts automatically organized by state (active first, completed last)

### Why We Built This

Users told us the dashboard felt cluttered when browsing many artifacts. Work-in-progress items were mixed with completed work, making it hard to quickly find what needed attention. This update improves dashboard scannability and supports rapid task discovery.

### How to Use

#### Filter Completed Artifacts

1. Open FA or BA Dashboard
2. Look for "Show Completed Artifacts" toggle at the top of the artifact list
3. Click toggle to hide/show finished work items
4. Your preference is remembered across sessions

**What counts as "Completed"?**
- Done: Completed and closed
- Retired: No longer in use
- Deferred: Moved to later release
- Out-of-Scope: Explicitly excluded
- Archived: Historical reference

#### Automatic State Ordering

Artifacts are now automatically ordered by priority:
1. **In-Progress** — Active work items (highest priority)
2. **Active** — Items in production
3. **Ready** — Approved for implementation
4. **Draft** — Items in development
5. **Proposed** — Proposed, awaiting approval
6. **Pending** — Waiting for external dependencies
7. **On-Hold** — Explicitly paused
8. **Deferred** — Moved to later release
9. **Out-of-Scope** — Explicitly excluded
10. **Done** — Completed items
11. **Retired** — No longer in use
12. **Archived** — Historical reference

Within each state group, artifacts are alphabetized for consistency.

### FAQ

**Q: Can I reorder artifacts manually?**
A: Not in this release. Artifacts follow the state-based ordering. We're considering custom sort options for future updates.

**Q: What if I always want to see completed artifacts?**
A: The filter defaults to "Show All". Just check "Show Completed Artifacts" and it will be remembered.

**Q: Can I customize the filter for my dashboard?**
A: The current filter toggles completed artifacts on/off. We're open to feedback on additional filtering options.

**Q: How do I change an artifact's state?**
A: Edit the artifact and update the `status:` field in the YAML frontmatter.

### Technical Details

- Filter preference stored in browser localStorage (per role/dashboard)
- Filtering and sorting done client-side for performance
- Works on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Accessible via keyboard and screen readers (WCAG 2.1 AA)

# Dashboard Filtering and Ordering Architecture

## Overview

The filtering and ordering feature enables users to focus on active work by:
1. Toggling visibility of completed artifacts
2. Automatically organizing artifacts by state priority

## Components

### useArtifactFilter Hook
**File**: `hooks/useArtifactFilter.ts`
- Manages filter toggle state
- Persists state to localStorage
- Returns { showCompleted, setShowCompleted }

### State Ordering Utilities
**File**: `utils/artifactSorting.ts`
- `sortArtifacts()`: Sort by state priority, then alphabetically
- `groupArtifactsByState()`: Group artifacts by state

### State Priority Configuration
**File**: `constants/stateOrdering.ts`
- `STATE_PRIORITY`: Maps state → priority number (1-12)
- `STATE_GROUPS`: Groups states by category (Active, Waiting, Completed)
- `TERMINAL_STATES`: List of completed states to filter

### Dashboard Components
**Files**: `FADashboard.tsx`, `BADashboard.tsx`
- Use useArtifactFilter hook
- Apply filtering and sorting to artifact lists

## Adding New States

To add a new state in the future:

1. Add to `STATE_PRIORITY` in `constants/stateOrdering.ts` with priority number
2. Update `STATE_GROUPS` if it belongs to a different category
3. Update `TERMINAL_STATES` if it's a completed state
4. Update this documentation
5. Test filtering and sorting with new state

Example:
```typescript
// constants/stateOrdering.ts
export const STATE_PRIORITY = {
  // ... existing states ...
  'in-review': 2.5,  // Insert between 'active' and 'ready'
};
```

## Testing

See stories s-e007-001 through s-e007-004 for test locations and coverage requirements.
