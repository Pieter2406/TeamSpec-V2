## Feature Impact

### Impact Type

- [ ] **Adds Behavior** — New capability not currently in the feature
- [x] **Changes Behavior** — Modifies existing documented behavior
- [ ] **Fixes Defect**
- [ ] **Technical Only**

### AS-IS (current behavior)

**Reference:** f-TSV-002, Section: Role Selection

- RoleSelector component displays BA and FA role options only
- User can select between BA and FA roles
- Selection is stored in RoleContext and persists for the session
- Role switching via header badge is supported

### TO-BE (new behavior)

- RoleSelector component displays **five** role options: BA, FA, DEV, SA, QA
- Each role is displayed with:
  - Role name (e.g., "Developer", "Solution Architect", "QA Engineer")
  - Role code (e.g., "DEV", "SA", "QA")
  - Brief description of artifact types managed by role
- User can select any of the five roles
- Selection triggers navigation to the corresponding dashboard component
- Role switching between all five roles is supported via header badge

- **Then** five role options are visible: BA, FA, DEV, SA, QA

### Scenario 2: Select DEV Role

- **Given** the RoleSelector is displayed
- **When** the user clicks on "Developer (DEV)"
- **Then** the role context is updated to "DEV"
- **And** the user is navigated to the DEV dashboard

### Scenario 3: Select SA Role

- **Given** the RoleSelector is displayed
- **When** the user clicks on "Solution Architect (SA)"
- **Then** the role context is updated to "SA"
- **And** the user is navigated to the SA dashboard

### Scenario 4: Select QA Role

- **Given** the RoleSelector is displayed
- **When** the user clicks on "QA Engineer (QA)"
- **Then** the role context is updated to "QA"
- **And** the user is navigated to the QA dashboard

### Scenario 5: Role Switching via Header Badge

- **Given** the user has selected DEV role
- **When** the user clicks the role badge in the header
- **Then** the RoleSelector is displayed
- **And** the user can switch to any other role (BA, FA, SA, QA)

### Scenario 6: Role Descriptions Displayed

- **Given** the RoleSelector is displayed
- **When** viewing the DEV option
- **Then** it shows description: "Dev-plans, stories, technical docs"
- **When** viewing the SA option
- **Then** it shows description: "Solution designs, technical architectures"
- **When** viewing the QA option
- **Then** it shows description: "Test cases, regression tests, bug reports"
