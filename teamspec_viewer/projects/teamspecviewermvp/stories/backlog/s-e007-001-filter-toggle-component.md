## User Story

**As a** TeamSpec user (FA, BA, Developer),  
**I want** to toggle visibility of completed artifacts on the dashboard,  
**So that** I can focus on active work without visual clutter from finished items.

## Feature Impact

### Impact Type

- [x] **Adds Behavior** — New capability not currently in the feature
- [ ] **Changes Behavior** — Modifies existing documented behavior
- [ ] **Fixes Defect** — Restores behavior to match documentation
- [ ] **Technical Only** — Refactor/performance with no user-observable change

### AS-IS (current behavior)

**Reference:** f-TSV-002, Section: Dashboard Display

Currently, the Role-Specific Dashboard displays all artifacts owned by the user's role, regardless of their state. Users see a flat list that includes active items (draft, active, ready) mixed with completed items (done, retired, deferred). There is no filtering mechanism to hide or show artifacts based on state.

### TO-BE (new behavior)

The Role-Specific Dashboard displays a **filter toggle control** labeled "Show Completed Artifacts" that allows users to:

1. **Toggle Visibility**: Click/tap to toggle between showing and hiding artifacts in terminal states
2. **Default Behavior**: All artifacts shown by default (filter toggle is checked)
3. **Filtered View**: When unchecked, artifacts with terminal states (done, retired, out-of-scope, deferred, archived) are hidden from the dashboard
4. **Active States Remain**: Artifacts with active states (draft, active, ready, in-progress, proposed, pending, on-hold) always remain visible
5. **Control Placement**: Filter toggle appears at the top of the artifact list, before the list begins

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional

- [ ] **Component Exists**: Dashboard displays "Show Completed Artifacts" toggle control (checkbox or toggle button)
- [ ] **Toggle Functional**: Clicking toggle changes the visual state (checked/unchecked)
- [ ] **Default State**: Toggle is checked by default (all artifacts visible initially)
- [ ] **Filter Applied Immediately**: Artifacts hide/show immediately when toggle changes (no page reload needed)
- [ ] **Correct Terminal States Hidden**: When toggled off, all artifacts with states [done, retired, out-of-scope, deferred, archived] are hidden
- [ ] **Active States Visible**: When toggled off, all artifacts with states [draft, active, ready, in-progress, proposed, pending, on-hold] remain visible
- [ ] **Works on All Dashboard Types**: Filter works on both FA Dashboard and BA Dashboard
- [ ] **Works for All Artifact Types**: Filter applies to all artifact types listed (Features, Epics, Stories, Feature-Increments, Business Analysis docs, etc.)

### Persistence

- [ ] **Filter State Persists**: Toggle state is saved to browser localStorage
- [ ] **Persistence Key**: Uses a unique key per dashboard/role (e.g., `showCompleted_FA` or `showCompleted_BA`)
- [ ] **Survives Page Reload**: Filter state survives browser page refresh (F5)
- [ ] **Survives Browser Close**: Filter state persists across browser sessions

### Usability

- [ ] **Clear Label**: Label text is clear and understandable ("Show Completed Artifacts")
- [ ] **Tooltip/Help**: Hover tooltip explains which states are considered "completed" (done, retired, deferred, out-of-scope, archived)
- [ ] **Visual Feedback**: Toggle shows clear checked/unchecked state
- [ ] **Placement**: Toggle appears prominently at top of artifact list, not buried in menu or hidden

### Accessibility

- [ ] **Keyboard Accessible**: Toggle can be activated via Tab and Space/Enter keys
- [ ] **Screen Reader Announced**: Toggle label is announced by screen readers with proper ARIA attributes
- [ ] **Focus Visible**: Focus indicator visible when keyboard navigating to toggle
- [ ] **No Color-Only Indication**: Completed state not indicated by color alone; has additional affordance

### Technical

- [ ] **No Performance Regression**: Toggle action triggers filter in <100ms
- [ ] **Mobile Responsive**: Toggle control is visible and functional on mobile/tablet screen sizes
- [ ] **No Blocking**: Filter implementation doesn't block other dashboard functionality

### Testing

- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Tests for toggle state management and localStorage interaction
- [ ] **Component Tests**: Tests for toggle render, click handling, and artifact visibility changes
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Tests with real dashboard and artifact data
- [ ] **E2E Tests**: User flow: load dashboard → toggle off → artifacts hidden → reload page → toggle state persisted

## Technical Notes for DEV

### Frontend Components to Update

1. **FADashboard.tsx / BADashboard.tsx**
   - Import filter toggle component (create or use existing MUI Checkbox/Switch)
   - Add state hook for showCompleted: `const [showCompleted, setShowCompleted] = useState(...)`
   - Add localStorage hook to persist state
   - Render toggle control at top of artifact list
   - Pass showCompleted prop to child artifact list component

2. **Create useArtifactFilter Hook** (recommended)
   ```tsx
   const useArtifactFilter = (defaultValue = true) => {
     const [showCompleted, setShowCompleted] = useState(() => {
       const stored = localStorage.getItem('showCompleted');
       return stored !== null ? stored === 'true' : defaultValue;
     });
     
     useEffect(() => {
       localStorage.setItem('showCompleted', showCompleted.toString());
     }, [showCompleted]);
     
     return { showCompleted, setShowCompleted };
   };
   ```

### Code Pattern

```tsx
// In Dashboard component
const { showCompleted, setShowCompleted } = useArtifactFilter();

return (
  <div>
    <Box sx={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', mb: 2 }}>
      <FormControlLabel
        control={
          <Checkbox
            checked={showCompleted}
            onChange={(e) => setShowCompleted(e.target.checked)}
          />
        }
        label="Show Completed Artifacts"
        title="Show/hide artifacts with states: done, retired, deferred, out-of-scope, archived"
      />
    </Box>
    
    <ArtifactList artifacts={artifacts} showCompleted={showCompleted} />
  </div>
);
```

### Data Requirements

- Artifacts must have accessible `status` field from YAML frontmatter
- Terminal state values: 'done', 'retired', 'out-of-scope', 'deferred', 'archived'
- Implementation independent of how artifacts are fetched (API vs. static data)

---

## UX & Copy

**Toggle Label:** "Show Completed Artifacts"

**Tooltip/Hover Text:** "Toggle to hide/show completed work items (done, retired, deferred, out-of-scope, archived)"

**Alternative Labels (if needed):**
- "Show All Work" / "Show Active Only"
- "Completed Artifacts" (with separate on/off labels)

**Recommendation:** Use "Show Completed Artifacts" for clarity and consistency with state terminology.
