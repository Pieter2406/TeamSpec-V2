## User Story

**As a** DEV,  
**I want** the repository and local dev environment set up to run the TeamSpec Viewer frontend and backend,  
**So that** the dashboard epic can be implemented and verified end-to-end.

---

## Linked Epic

| Epic ID | Epic Name | Product |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| [epic-TSV-001](../../epics/epic-TSV-001-dashboard-implementation.md) | Dashboard implementation (BA/FA) | Teamspec Viewer (TSV) |

---

## Linked Feature-Increment

| FI ID | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [fi-TSV-001](../../feature-increments/fi-TSV-001-ba-fa-role-dashboards.md) | BA/FA dashboards increment (enables implementation) |

## Feature Impact

### Impact Type

- [ ] **Adds Behavior**
- [ ] **Changes Behavior**
- [ ] **Fixes Defect**
- [x] **Technical Only** — Refactor/performance with no user-observable change

### AS-IS (current behavior)

**Reference:** f-TSV-002, Section: Current Behavior

- No deployed dashboard behavior exists in production (greenfield product).

### TO-BE (new behavior)

- The project has a runnable local development setup for the TeamSpec Viewer frontend and backend.
- Developers can start both services and access the app in a browser.

---

## Acceptance Criteria (AC)

### Scenario 1: Local run baseline

- **Given** the repository is cloned and prerequisites are installed
- **When** the developer follows the project run instructions
- **Then** the frontend and backend start successfully with no fatal errors

### Scenario 2: Health check

- **Given** the backend service is running
- **When** a developer performs a basic health check
- **Then** the backend returns a success response

---

## Technical Notes

- **API**: GET /health endpoint for backend readiness check
- **DB**: None (file-system only)
- **TAI**: Aligns with TA-001 (React frontend) and TA-002 (Hono backend)

## UX & Copy

- No UI required

## Sources Consulted

- teamspec_viewer/projects/teamspecviewermvp/epics/epic-TSV-001-dashboard-implementation.md → Scope (technical setup required to deliver epic)
- teamspec_viewer/projects/teamspecviewermvp/feature-increments/fi-TSV-001-ba-fa-role-dashboards.md → Epic reference + delivery slice

## Unresolved Items

- Exact run commands / tooling choices (package manager, scripts) → Use pnpm with `pnpm dev` for concurrent frontend+backend (DEV decision)
- Backend health check endpoint definition → GET /health returns { status: "ok" } (SA/DEV input)
