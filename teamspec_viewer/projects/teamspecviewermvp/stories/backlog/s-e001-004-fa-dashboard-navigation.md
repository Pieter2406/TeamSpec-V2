## User Story

**As a** FA,  
**I want** a dashboard that lists FA artifacts for the selected product/project context,  
**So that** I can quickly open features, feature-increments, and project execution artifacts.

## Feature Impact

### Impact Type

- [x] **Adds Behavior**
- [ ] **Changes Behavior**
- [ ] **Fixes Defect**
- [ ] **Technical Only**

### AS-IS (current behavior)

**Reference:** f-TSV-002, Section: Current Behavior → Role Dashboard Content

- No deployed FA dashboard content exists in production (greenfield product).

### TO-BE (new behavior)

- When the user selects the **FA** role, the dashboard lists entry points to:
  - Feature Canon for the selected product
  - Feature-Increments for the selected project
  - Epics and Stories for the selected project when they exist
- Selecting an item opens the artifact for reading.

---

## Acceptance Criteria (AC)

### Scenario 1: FA dashboard lists FA artifacts

- **Given** the user selected the FA role
- **When** the FA dashboard is displayed
- **Then** the dashboard includes entry points to product Feature Canon
- **And** the dashboard includes entry points to project Feature-Increments

### Scenario 2: Epic/story presence

- **Given** the project contains epics and/or stories
- **When** the FA dashboard is displayed
- **Then** the dashboard includes entry points to epics and stories

---

## Technical Notes

- **API**: GET /products/{productId}/features, GET /projects/{projectId}/feature-increments, GET /projects/{projectId}/epics, GET /projects/{projectId}/stories
- **DB**: None (file-system based via Hono server)
- **TAI**: Aligns with TA-002 (Hono file serving for FA artifacts)

---

## UX & Copy

- Group labels: “Features”, “Feature-Increments”, “Epics”, “Stories”

## Sources Consulted

- teamspec_viewer/projects/teamspecviewermvp/feature-increments/fi-TSV-001-ba-fa-role-dashboards.md → Section 3.1 “Role Dashboard Content (MVP)” (FA dashboard)

## Unresolved Items

- Whether epics/stories appear when empty vs hidden entirely → Hide section if no artifacts exist
