## Metadata

| **Story ID** | s-e005-002 |
| **Epic** | epic-TSV-005 |
| **Status** | Backlog |
| **Estimate** | 5 SP |

**Document Owner:** FA (Functional Analyst)  
**Artifact Type:** Execution (Delta to Feature Canon)  
**Lifecycle:** Sprint-bound, archived after completion

## User Story

**As a** Functional Analyst,  
**I want** a collapsible tree view that shows Feature → FI → Epic → Story hierarchy,  
**So that** I can visually trace the relationships between artifacts without mental mapping.

---

## Linked Epic

| Epic ID | Epic Name | Product |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| [epic-TSV-005](../../epics/epic-TSV-005-usecase-centric-dashboard.md) | Use-Case Centric Dashboard | Teamspec Viewer (TSV) |

---

## Linked Feature-Increment

| FI ID | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [fi-TSV-005](../../feature-increments/fi-TSV-005-usecase-centric-dashboard.md) | Use-case centric dashboard with visual artifact tree |

## Feature Impact

### Impact Type

- [x] **Adds Behavior** — New capability not currently in the feature
- [ ] **Changes Behavior**
- [ ] **Fixes Defect**
- [ ] **Technical Only**

### AS-IS (current behavior)

**Reference:** f-TSV-002, Section: Current Behavior → Role Dashboard Content

- FA Dashboard displays artifacts in flat lists
- No visual representation of relationships between artifacts
- User must mentally map Feature → FI → Epic → Story relationships

### TO-BE (new behavior)

- When a Feature card is expanded, a **collapsible tree view** is rendered showing:
  ```
  Feature (root)
  └── Feature-Increment(s)
      └── Epic(s)
          └── Story(ies)
  ```
- Each tree level is indented to show hierarchy
- Tree nodes can be individually expanded/collapsed
- Visual connectors (lines) show parent-child relationships
- Project context label appears on FI nodes (e.g., "(Project: teamspecviewermvp)")

## Sprint Assignment

**Sprint:** —  
**Assigned By:** ________________  
**Role:** SM  
**Date:** ________________

---

## Acceptance Criteria (AC)

### Scenario 1: Tree renders when Feature expanded

- **Given** the user is viewing a Feature card
- **When** the user clicks the expand toggle
- **Then** a tree view renders showing linked FIs as first-level children
- **And** each FI node can be expanded to show linked Epics
- **And** each Epic node can be expanded to show linked Stories

### Scenario 2: Tree hierarchy is visually clear

- **Given** the tree view is displayed
- **When** the user views the tree
- **Then** each level is visually indented from its parent
- **And** connector lines (│ ├── └──) show parent-child relationships

### Scenario 3: Individual node expand/collapse

- **Given** a tree is displayed with multiple levels
- **When** the user clicks a node's expand/collapse toggle
- **Then** only that node's children are shown/hidden
- **And** other expanded nodes remain unchanged

### Scenario 4: Expand All / Collapse All

- **Given** a Feature tree is displayed
- **When** the user clicks "Expand All"
- **Then** all nodes in the tree are expanded
- **When** the user clicks "Collapse All"
- **Then** all nodes collapse to show only FI level

### Scenario 5: Node displays artifact info

- **Given** a tree node is rendered
- **When** the user views the node
- **Then** the node displays: artifact ID, title, and status indicator
- **And** FI nodes display project context (e.g., "(Project: MVP)")

### Scenario 6: Empty children

- **Given** a Feature has FIs but an FI has no linked Epic
- **When** the FI node is expanded
- **Then** the tree shows "(No linked epics)" placeholder

---

## Technical Notes

- **Component**: Create `ArtifactTree.tsx` component
- **Library Options**: MUI TreeView, react-arborist, or custom implementation
- **Data Structure**:
  ```typescript
  interface TreeNode {
    id: string;
    type: 'feature' | 'fi' | 'epic' | 'story';
    title: string;
    status?: string;
    project?: string;
    children: TreeNode[];
  }
  ```
- **State**: Track expanded node IDs in Set for O(1) lookup

---

## UX & Copy

- Connector characters: `│`, `├──`, `└──`
- Expand icon: `►` or `▶`
- Collapse icon: `▼` or `▾`
- Empty placeholder: "(No linked {artifacts})"
- Buttons: "Expand All", "Collapse All"
