## User Story

**As a** BA or FA,  
**I want** `{TBD}` markers in an opened artifact to be highlighted and navigable,  
**So that** I can quickly see what documentation is incomplete.

## Feature Impact

### Impact Type

- [x] **Adds Behavior**
- [ ] **Changes Behavior**
- [ ] **Fixes Defect**
- [ ] **Technical Only**

### AS-IS (current behavior)

**Reference:** f-TSV-002, Section: In Scope

- No deployed TBD marker highlighting/navigation exists in production (greenfield product).

### TO-BE (new behavior)

- When an artifact is opened for reading, `{TBD}` occurrences are highlighted.
- The user can navigate between occurrences (next/previous) within the currently opened artifact.

---

## Acceptance Criteria (AC)

### Scenario 1: Highlight `{TBD}`

- **Given** an artifact is displayed for reading
- **And** the artifact contains the text `{TBD}`
- **When** the artifact is rendered
- **Then** `{TBD}` occurrences are visually highlighted

### Scenario 2: Navigate between occurrences

- **Given** an artifact contains multiple `{TBD}` occurrences
- **When** the user navigates to the next `{TBD}`
- **Then** the reading position moves to the next `{TBD}` occurrence

---

## Technical Notes

- **API**: None (TBD detection is client-side post-render)
- **DB**: None
- **TAI**: Aligns with TA-001 (React component for TBD highlighting)

---

## UX & Copy

- `{TBD}` marker label remains literal: `{TBD}`

## Unresolved Items

- Whether to provide a total `{TBD}` count in the viewer → Yes, show count badge (e.g., "3 TBDs")
- Keyboard shortcuts vs buttons for next/previous navigation → Buttons in MVP; keyboard shortcuts deferred
