## User Story

**As a** TeamSpec Viewer application,  
**I want** a backend API endpoint that returns linked artifacts for a Feature,  
**So that** the frontend can render the artifact relationship tree.

---

## Linked Epic

| Epic ID | Epic Name | Product |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| [epic-TSV-005](../../epics/epic-TSV-005-usecase-centric-dashboard.md) | Use-Case Centric Dashboard | Teamspec Viewer (TSV) |

---

## Linked Feature-Increment

| FI ID | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [fi-TSV-005](../../feature-increments/fi-TSV-005-usecase-centric-dashboard.md) | Use-case centric dashboard with visual artifact tree |

## Feature Impact

### Impact Type

- [x] **Adds Behavior** — New capability not currently in the feature
- [ ] **Changes Behavior**
- [ ] **Fixes Defect**
- [ ] **Technical Only**

### AS-IS (current behavior)

**Reference:** Technical Architecture

- Backend provides separate endpoints for each artifact type:
  - `GET /api/products/:productId/features` — lists features
  - `GET /api/projects/:projectId/feature-increments` — lists FIs
  - `GET /api/projects/:projectId/epics` — lists epics
  - `GET /api/projects/:projectId/stories` — lists stories
- No endpoint exists to retrieve linked/related artifacts for a given Feature
- Frontend must make 4 separate calls and perform client-side joining

### TO-BE (new behavior)

- New API endpoint: `GET /api/features/:featureId/relationships`
- Endpoint returns a nested structure showing:
  - The Feature details
  - All Feature-Increments that target this Feature (with project context)
  - For each FI: linked Epic (if any)
  - For each Epic: linked Stories
- Response includes artifact ID, title, status, and project for each item

**Sprint:** —  
**Assigned By:** ________________  
**Role:** SM  
**Date:** ________________

## Acceptance Criteria (AC)

### Scenario 1: Endpoint returns Feature with linked FIs

- **Given** Feature `f-TSV-002` exists with linked FIs `fi-TSV-001` and `fi-TSV-005`
- **When** client calls `GET /api/features/f-TSV-002/relationships`
- **Then** response includes Feature details
- **And** response includes both FIs in `featureIncrements` array
- **And** each FI includes `project` field indicating owning project

### Scenario 2: FI includes linked Epic

- **Given** `fi-TSV-001` links to `epic-TSV-001`
- **When** relationships are retrieved for `f-TSV-002`
- **Then** `fi-TSV-001` object includes `epic` object with epic details

### Scenario 3: Epic includes linked Stories

- **Given** `epic-TSV-001` has stories `s-e001-001`, `s-e001-002`
- **When** relationships are retrieved
- **Then** epic object includes `stories` array with story details

### Scenario 4: Feature with no linked FIs

- **Given** Feature `f-TSV-999` exists with no linked FIs
- **When** client calls `GET /api/features/f-TSV-999/relationships`
- **Then** response includes Feature details
- **And** `featureIncrements` is an empty array `[]`

### Scenario 5: Response structure

- **Given** a valid Feature ID
- **When** relationships are retrieved
- **Then** response matches this structure:
  ```json
  {
    "feature": {
      "id": "f-TSV-002",
      "title": "Role-Specific Dashboards",
      "status": "Planned"
    },
    "featureIncrements": [
      {
        "id": "fi-TSV-001",
        "title": "BA/FA Role Dashboards",
        "status": "proposed",
        "project": "teamspecviewermvp",
        "epic": {
          "id": "epic-TSV-001",
          "title": "Dashboard Implementation",
          "status": "In Progress",
          "stories": [
            { "id": "s-e001-001", "title": "Technical Setup", "status": "Done" },
            { "id": "s-e001-002", "title": "Role Selection", "status": "Backlog" }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### Scenario 6: Invalid Feature ID

- **Given** Feature ID `f-INVALID-999` does not exist
- **When** client calls `GET /api/features/f-INVALID-999/relationships`
- **Then** response is HTTP 404 with error message

---

## Technical Notes

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/features/:featureId/relationships`
- **Implementation**: 
  1. Parse Feature file to get metadata
  2. Scan all projects' feature-increments for FIs targeting this Feature
  3. For each FI, check YAML frontmatter for linked epic
  4. For each Epic, scan stories folder for `s-eXXX-*` files
- **Performance**: Consider caching relationship data; scan can be expensive
- **TAI**: Aligns with ta-TSV-002 (Hono.js backend)

- Backend code in `teamspec_viewer/backend/src/`

## Unresolved Items

- ~~Caching strategy for relationship data~~ → **RESOLVED**: MVP uses no caching (on-demand file scan); if performance issues arise, implement in-memory LRU cache with 60-second TTL, invalidated on file watch events
