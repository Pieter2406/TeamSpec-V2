**As a** BA or FA,  
**I want** to select my role before viewing a dashboard (and switch roles within a session),  
**So that** I can access the dashboard content relevant to my role.

## Feature Impact

### Impact Type

- [x] **Adds Behavior**
- [ ] **Changes Behavior**
- [ ] **Fixes Defect**
- [ ] **Technical Only**

### AS-IS (current behavior)

**Reference:** f-TSV-002, Section: Current Behavior → Role Selection

- No deployed role selection behavior exists in production (greenfield product).

### TO-BE (new behavior)

- The user can select either **BA** or **FA** as their role.
- The currently selected role is always visible while navigating artifacts.
- The user can switch roles within the same session.

---

## Acceptance Criteria (AC)

### Scenario 1: Select BA role

- **Given** the user is not yet in a role dashboard
- **When** the user selects the **BA** role
- **Then** the BA dashboard is shown
- **And** the UI indicates the current role is **BA**

### Scenario 2: Select FA role

- **Given** the user is not yet in a role dashboard
- **When** the user selects the **FA** role
- **Then** the FA dashboard is shown
- **And** the UI indicates the current role is **FA**

### Scenario 3: Switch roles within a session

- **Given** the user is currently viewing the BA dashboard
- **When** the user switches to the FA role
- **Then** the FA dashboard is shown

---

## Technical Notes

- **API**: None (role state is frontend-only in MVP)
- **DB**: None (no persistence for role selection in MVP)
- **TAI**: Aligns with TA-001 (React Context for state management)

---

## UX & Copy

- Role labels: “BA”, “FA”

## Sources Consulted

- teamspec_viewer/projects/teamspecviewermvp/feature-increments/fi-TSV-001-ba-fa-role-dashboards.md → Section 3.1 “Role Selection (MVP)”
- teamspec_viewer/projects/teamspecviewermvp/epics/epic-TSV-001-dashboard-implementation.md → Target state (role selection)

## Unresolved Items

- Persist role across sessions → Out of scope for MVP (browser session only, per fi-TSV-001)
