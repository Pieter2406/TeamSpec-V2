## User Story

**As a** QA Engineer and Accessibility Advocate,  
**I want** to verify that the dashboard filtering and ordering features work correctly across all use cases and are accessible to all users,  
**So that** the feature is production-ready and doesn't create barriers for users with disabilities.

## Feature Impact

### Impact Type

- [ ] **Adds Behavior** — New capability not currently in the feature
- [ ] **Changes Behavior** — Modifies existing documented behavior
- [ ] **Fixes Defect** — Restores behavior to match documentation
- [x] **Technical Only** — Refactor/performance with no user-observable change

### AS-IS (current behavior)

**Reference:** Stories s-e007-001, s-e007-002, s-e007-003 are implemented but not yet verified for correctness, edge cases, or accessibility compliance.

The feature is functionally implemented but requires comprehensive testing to ensure:
- All acceptance criteria from previous stories are met
- Edge cases are handled gracefully
- Performance is acceptable
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) are met
- No regressions introduced

### TO-BE (new behavior)

The dashboard filtering and ordering feature is fully tested and verified to:
- Pass all acceptance criteria from stories s-e007-001 through s-e007-003
- Handle edge cases correctly (private browsing, no localStorage, etc.)
- Perform efficiently with realistic artifact volumes (100+ items)
- Be accessible to users with disabilities via keyboard and screen reader
- Work on all supported browsers and screen sizes
- Not introduce performance regressions

The feature is ready for production deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Unit & Component Testing

- [ ] **Filter Toggle Tests**: Unit tests for toggle state management, localStorage interaction
- [ ] **Ordering Tests**: Unit tests for state ordering logic with various state combinations
- [ ] **Component Tests**: Component tests for filter toggle render, interaction, visual state changes
- [ ] **Hook Tests**: Tests for useArtifactFilter hook initialization, state updates, localStorage sync
- [ ] **Utility Tests**: Tests for sortArtifacts() and groupArtifactsByState() utilities

### Integration Testing

- [ ] **Dashboard Integration**: Test filter toggle integrated with dashboard artifact list
- [ ] **Real Data**: Test with real artifact data (not mocked)
- [ ] **Multiple Dashboards**: Test FA and BA dashboards independently
- [ ] **State Transitions**: Test toggling filter on/off repeatedly; verify artifacts hide/show correctly
- [ ] **Cross-Story Integration**: Verify story s-e007-001, 002, 003 work together seamlessly

### E2E Testing

- [ ] **Full User Flow**: User opens dashboard → toggles filter → reloads page → filter state persists
- [ ] **Multiple Artifacts**: Dashboard with 50+, 100+, and 200+ artifacts tested
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: 
  - [ ] Private/incognito browsing mode (localStorage unavailable)
  - [ ] Cache cleared by user (localStorage reset)
  - [ ] Multiple browser tabs open simultaneously
  - [ ] Very long artifact titles (ensure sorting doesn't break)
  - [ ] Artifacts with missing or invalid status values
- [ ] **Browser Compatibility**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (current and previous versions)
- [ ] **Mobile Testing**: iPad, iPhone (landscape and portrait), Android tablet

### Accessibility Testing

- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation**: Filter toggle accessible via Tab key; activatable with Space/Enter
- [ ] **Screen Reader Support**: 
  - [ ] Toggle label announced correctly
  - [ ] Checked/unchecked state announced
  - [ ] State group headers announced (if present)
  - [ ] Artifact list updates announced (if using ARIA live regions)
- [ ] **Color Contrast**: State labels and grouped sections meet WCAG AA contrast ratios
- [ ] **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Full audit using automated tools (axe, WAVE) + manual testing
- [ ] **Focus Indicators**: Keyboard focus clearly visible on filter toggle and any interactive elements
- [ ] **No Color-Only Indication**: State grouping not indicated by color alone; relies on text/structure

### Performance Testing

- [ ] **Filter Toggle**: Toggle action executes in <50ms
- [ ] **Artifact Sorting**: Sorting 100+ artifacts in <100ms
- [ ] **Component Re-render**: Filter state change triggers minimal unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] **localStorage Operations**: Read/write operations in <10ms
- [ ] **Memory Profiling**: No memory leaks when toggling filter repeatedly
- [ ] **Bundle Size**: Feature doesn't significantly increase JavaScript bundle size

### Regression Testing

- [ ] **Dashboard Functionality**: All existing dashboard features still work (navigation, artifact display, etc.)
- [ ] **Other Features**: Features f-TSV-001, f-TSV-003, f-TSV-004 unaffected
- [ ] **API Integration**: Filter doesn't interfere with artifact data fetching
- [ ] **Existing Tests**: All existing test suites pass (no breakage)

### Documentation & Release

- [ ] **QA Test Report**: Comprehensive report documenting all test cases, results, issues found
- [ ] **Known Issues**: Any known limitations or edge cases documented
- [ ] **Release Notes**: User-facing documentation explaining new filter and ordering features
- [ ] **Developer Notes**: Technical documentation for future maintainers

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Filter Toggle
1. User opens FA Dashboard
2. User sees "Show Completed Artifacts" toggle (checked by default)
3. User sees all artifacts (active + completed)
4. User clicks toggle to uncheck
5. **Expected**: Completed artifacts hidden; active artifacts remain visible
6. User clicks toggle again to check
7. **Expected**: All artifacts visible again

### Scenario 2: Filter Persistence
1. User opens FA Dashboard
2. User unchecks "Show Completed Artifacts" filter
3. User closes browser completely
4. User opens browser and navigates to dashboard
5. **Expected**: Filter toggle remains unchecked; completed artifacts hidden

### Scenario 3: State Ordering with Many Artifacts
1. Dashboard has 100+ artifacts across all states
2. User views dashboard
3. **Expected**: Artifacts grouped and ordered:
   - in-progress first (if any)
   - active next
   - ready, draft, proposed
   - pending, on-hold
   - deferred, out-of-scope, done, retired, archived at bottom
   - Within each state, alphabetical by title

### Scenario 4: Private Browsing Mode
1. User opens browser in private/incognito mode
2. User navigates to dashboard
3. User unchecks filter
4. User reloads page
5. **Expected**: Feature works gracefully; localStorage unavailable, filter resets to default (acceptable behavior)

### Scenario 5: Keyboard Navigation
1. User navigates to dashboard using keyboard only (no mouse)
2. User presses Tab to reach "Show Completed Artifacts" filter
3. **Expected**: Focus visible on filter toggle
4. User presses Space or Enter
5. **Expected**: Filter toggles; artifacts hide/show
6. Screen reader announces the state change

### Scenario 6: Edge Case - Missing Status Field
1. Some artifacts don't have `status:` field in YAML frontmatter
2. User opens dashboard
3. **Expected**: Feature handles gracefully; defaults to a sensible state or groups them separately
