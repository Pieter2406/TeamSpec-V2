## User Story

**As a** Business Analyst using the BA Dashboard,  
**I want** to click status chips in the BATree (BA documents, BA Increments) and change their status,  
**So that** I can update analysis workflow state during review cycles.

## Feature Impact

### Impact Type

- [ ] **Adds Behavior**
- [x] **Changes Behavior** — Modifies existing documented behavior
- [ ] **Fixes Defect**
- [ ] **Technical Only**

### AS-IS (current behavior)

**Reference:** f-TSV-008, Section: Current Behavior → Status Display

- BATree displays status as read-only colored chips
- Status chips use centralized colors from artifactIcons.ts
- No click handler on status chips
- Status cannot be changed from BA tree view

### TO-BE (new behavior)

- BATree status chips are replaced with StatusDropdown component
- Applicable to: Business Analysis (BA), BA Increment (BAI) nodes
- On status change:
  1. Call `PATCH /api/artifacts/status` API
  2. Show loading state on the chip
  3. On success: Update local state to reflect new status
  4. On error: Revert to previous status, show error toast
- Click propagation is stopped to prevent node selection when clicking status

---

## Acceptance Criteria (AC)

### Scenario 1: BA Document Status Edit

- **Given** BA Dashboard with BATree showing BA document with status "Draft"
- **When** user clicks the "Draft" status chip
- **Then** dropdown opens with options: Draft, Active, Deprecated

### Scenario 2: BAI Status Edit

- **Given** BATree showing BA Increment with status "Proposed"
- **When** user clicks status chip and selects "Approved"
- **Then** API is called and chip updates to "Approved" with amber color

### Scenario 3: Error Handling

- **Given** BATree with a BA document
- **When** user changes status but API returns error
- **Then** chip reverts to previous status and error toast appears

---

## Technical Notes

- **File**: `frontend/src/components/BATree.tsx`
- **Import**: StatusDropdown component
- **Reuse**: Same pattern as ArtifactTree integration (s-e006-004)
- **Event**: Use `event.stopPropagation()` on status chip click
