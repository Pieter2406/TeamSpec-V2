## Description

Business Analysis dashboard cards do not render artifact titles; cards display without the expected title text, violating the invariant that artifacts are primarily displayed by title.

---

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the application (Dev environment).
2. Select BA role and load the Business Analysis dashboard.
3. Observe the BA cards in the dashboard list/grid.

---

## Expected Result

Artifacts in BA dashboard cards should prominently display their title as the primary label.

**Feature Canon Reference:** {TBD}

---

## Actual Result

BA dashboard cards render without showing the artifact title; key label is missing on each card.

## Evidence

## Bug Classification (MANDATORY)

> ⚠️ Select **exactly ONE** classification. This determines who fixes what.

### [x] Implementation Defect

**Definition:** Code doesn't match Feature Canon documentation.

- **Evidence:** Titles are expected as primary artifact identifiers but are not rendered on BA cards.
- **Fix:** DEV fixes code to match Canon
- **Canon Update:** Not required

### [ ] Feature Canon Wrong

### [ ] Undocumented Behavior

---

## Classification Decision Tree

```
Is the behavior documented in Feature Canon?
├── YES → Does code match Canon?
│   ├── YES → Not a bug (or Canon is wrong → "Feature Canon Wrong")
│   └── NO → "Implementation Defect"
└── NO → "Undocumented Behavior"
```
