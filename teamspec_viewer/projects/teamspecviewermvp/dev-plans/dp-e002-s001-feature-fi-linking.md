## Linked Story

| Story ID | Title | Feature-Increment |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| [s-e002-001](../stories/backlog/s-e002-001-feature-fi-linking.md) | Feature ↔ FI Linking | [fi-TSV-002](../feature-increments/fi-TSV-002-ba-fa-feature-increment-navigation.md) |

---

## 1. Implementation Approach

### 1.1 Strategy

Create a **Feature List** view that displays all features from the product canon, with the ability to see associated Feature-Increments for the active project. This requires:
1. Backend endpoint to list features from `products/{id}/features/`
2. Backend endpoint to find FIs that target a specific feature
3. Frontend components for feature list and FI linking panel

### 1.2 Key Components

| Component | Change Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `features.ts` (route) | New | Backend route for feature APIs |
| `FeatureList.tsx` | New | UI component to display features |
| `FeatureFIPanel.tsx` | New | Panel showing FIs linked to selected feature |
| `FADashboard.tsx` | Modified | Add Features section with navigation |

---

## 2. Technical Design

### 2.1 Files to Create/Modify

| File Path | Action | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `backend/src/routes/features.ts` | Create | Feature listing and FI linking endpoints |
| `backend/src/index.ts` | Modify | Register features routes |
| `frontend/src/components/FeatureList.tsx` | Create | Feature list UI component |
| `frontend/src/components/FeatureFIPanel.tsx` | Create | FI linking panel for selected feature |
| `frontend/src/components/FADashboard.tsx` | Modify | Add Features navigation section |
| `frontend/src/api/features.ts` | Create | API client for feature endpoints |

### 2.2 Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Status |
|------------|------|--------|
| gray-matter | Existing | Approved (already in backend) |
| react-router-dom | Existing | Approved |

### 2.3 API Changes

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/features` | GET | List all features for active product |
| `/api/features/:featureId` | GET | Get feature details |
| `/api/features/:featureId/increments` | GET | Get FIs targeting this feature |

---

## 3. Testing Strategy

### 3.1 Unit Tests

- [ ] Feature route returns correct features from products directory
- [ ] FI linking correctly matches `target_feature` in FI front matter
- [ ] Empty feature list handled gracefully

### 3.2 Integration Tests

- [ ] Feature list endpoint returns valid JSON
- [ ] FI linking endpoint returns matching increments

### 3.3 Manual Testing

- [ ] Navigate to Features in FA dashboard
- [ ] Select a feature and verify FI list appears
- [ ] Click FI to navigate to FI detail view

---

## 4. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Feature files missing front matter | Medium | Medium | Graceful fallback to filename parsing |
| FI target_feature not consistently formatted | Medium | Low | Normalize pattern matching |

---

## 5. Acceptance Criteria Mapping

| AC # | Acceptance Criteria | Implementation Notes |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | FA can select a feature and see related FIs | FeatureList + FeatureFIPanel components |
| 2 | Selecting FI shows both AS-IS and TO-BE | Handled by s-e002-002 (separate story) |
| 3 | Navigation from FI to stories | Handled by s-e002-003 (separate story) |
