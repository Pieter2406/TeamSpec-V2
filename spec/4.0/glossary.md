## Core Concepts

### Product Canon

The complete set of production-truth documentation for a product.

- **Location:** `products/{product-id}/`
- **Includes:** features, business-analysis, solution-designs, technical-architecture, decisions, regression-tests
- **Status:** AS-IS (what is currently deployed)
- **Owner:** PO (approval authority)

**Note:** This is the umbrella term. All production truth lives here.

### Feature Canon

The behavioral subset of Product Canon — system behavior truth.

- **Location:** `products/{product-id}/features/`
- **Contains:** `f-PRX-NNN-*.md` files

**Note:** A subset of Product Canon, not a separate concept.

### Feature-Increment

A project artifact proposing changes to a product feature.

- **Location:** `projects/{project-id}/feature-increments/`
- **Contains:** `fi-PRX-NNN-*.md` files with AS-IS/TO-BE sections
- **Abbreviation:** FI
- **Status:** TO-BE (proposed state)
- **Owner:** FA

**Note:** TO-BE state becomes Feature Canon after deployment + sync.

### Epic

A coherent grouping of stories delivering a business outcome.

- **Location:** `projects/{project-id}/epics/`
- **Contains:** `epic-PRX-NNN-*.md` files
- **Owner:** FA

**Note:** All stories must link to an epic via filename.

### Story

A delta describing a change proposed by a Feature-Increment.

- **Location:** `projects/{project-id}/stories/{state}/`
- **Contains:** `s-eXXX-YYY-*.md` files
- **Owner:** FA

**Note:** Stories describe CHANGES, not full behavior.

### PRX (Product Prefix)

A unique 3-4 uppercase character identifier for each product.

- **Examples:** `ACME`, `DIT`, `BILL`
- **Assigned by:** PO at product creation
- **Rule:** NEVER changes after assignment

**Note:** Used in ALL artifact filenames for traceability.

## Gates

### DoR (Definition of Ready)

Checklist verified before a story enters development.

- **Owner:** FA
- **Verifier:** SM

### DoD (Definition of Done)

Checklist verified before a story is marked complete.

- **Owner:** FA
- **Verifier:** QA

### Deployment Verification Gate

Checklist verified **AFTER** code is deployed to production (and feature toggles enabled, if applicable), **BEFORE** `ts:po sync`. This ensures Canon is only updated when the change is available in production.

- **Owner:** SM
- **Approver:** PO
- **Verifier:** QA
- **Timing:** Post-deploy, pre-sync

### Canon Sync Gate

Gate for synchronizing project changes to Product Canon.

- **Owner:** PO
- **Precondition:** Deployment gate passed
- **Command:** `ts:po sync`
- **Timing:** POST-DEPLOY ONLY
