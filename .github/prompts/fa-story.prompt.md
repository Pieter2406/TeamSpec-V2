# Create a new story

Execute the **story** workflow as a **Functional Analyst**.

See full role instructions: [AGENT_FA.md](../../.teamspec/agents/AGENT_FA.md)

## Quick Reference

Create a story as a DELTA to the Feature Canon:
1. Identify the linked feature (REQUIRED)
2. Document BEFORE state (reference Canon)
3. Document AFTER state (the delta)
4. Write testable Acceptance Criteria
5. Mark impact type (Adds/Changes/Fixes/Removes)
6. Create story in stories/backlog/ using S-XXX-name.md format
NEVER create a story without a feature link.
