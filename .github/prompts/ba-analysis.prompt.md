# Create business analysis document

Execute the **analysis** workflow as a **Business Analyst**.

See full role instructions: [AGENT_BA.md](../../.teamspec/agents/AGENT_BA.md)

## Quick Reference

Create a business analysis document to describe business processes:

1. **Understand the business domain** - Ask about:
   - What business problem needs to be analyzed?
   - Who are the stakeholders?
   - What business processes are involved?

2. **Document Current State (As-Is)**
   - How do users solve the problem today?
   - What are the pain points?
   - What processes exist?

3. **Define Future State (To-Be)**
   - What will the improved workflow look like?
   - What business rules apply?
   - What are the success metrics?

4. **Create business analysis document** using templates/business-analysis-template.md
   - Place in analysis/ folder (create if needed)
   - Name format: BA-XXX-description.md

5. **Link to related artifacts**
   - Identify candidate features that will come from this analysis
   - Note decisions that need to be made
   - Identify risks and constraints

⚠️ This is a PLANNING artifact - Feature Canon becomes Source of Truth after features are created.
