# TeamSpec 4.0 Project Structure Encoding - YAML Reference
# This file encodes the Product/Project folder structure for use in AI prompts and automation
# Version: 4.0
# Last Updated: 2026-01-09

# =============================================================================
# CORE CONCEPT: Products vs Projects
# =============================================================================
# Products = Production truth (AS-IS state) - canonical, permanent
# Projects = Change proposals (TO-BE state) - time-bound, sync to product on deploy
